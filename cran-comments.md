## Submission note

* tabplot vesion 1.3-3 has been removed from CRAN on 2020-02-19 because of check problems. We have been able to solve these problems and subimitted version 1.3-4 on 2020-02-03. However, due to severe family circumstances, we were not able to fix the pretest issues (one warning). Please consider publication of tabplot version 1.4, in which all of the earlier issues have been solved.
